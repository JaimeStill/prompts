# Universal Narrative Development Workflow - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide presents a comprehensive workflow for developing rich, psychologically complex narratives using AI-assisted tools. The system is designed to scale across any genre, time period, or story type while maintaining authentic character depth and thematic sophistication.

## Core Methodology

### Workflow Philosophy

- **Separation of Ideation and Execution:** Creative exploration happens separately from formal writing, preventing constraints during discovery
- **Multi-Phase Development:** Each story element passes through multiple refinement stages with specific tools optimized for each phase
- **Psychological Authenticity:** All narrative elements receive deep psychological development beyond surface characteristics
- **Dynamic Element Interaction:** Story components influence each other in complex, realistic ways
- **Universal Scalability:** Framework adapts to any narrative type while maintaining core complexity principles

### Phase Process

1. **Pre-Podcast Development:** Establish comprehensive profiles for all narrative elements
2. **Exploratory Discussion:** Podcast-style collaborative development using established element profiles  
3. **Content Curation:** Extract and organize essential story elements from exploratory discussions
4. **First Draft Generation:** AI writing using curated elements and dynamic perspective application
5. **Collaborative Review:** Joint revision process maintaining creative vision and element authenticity
6. **Session Continuity Management:** Systematic checkpoint generation for optimized context handoff between sessions

## Narrative Element Framework

### Universal Element Types

The framework treats five core narrative elements with equal psychological complexity:

**Avatars (Characters):** Human or synthetic intelligence characters with deep psychological profiles
**Scenes (Environments):** Locations with atmospheric personality and character-influencing properties
**Organizations:** Groups with collective psychology, cultural DNA, and institutional behavioral patterns
**Technologies:** Tools, systems, or capabilities with developmental arcs and philosophical implications
**Philosophical Frameworks:** Ideas, principles, or belief systems that evolve through practical testing

### Element Development Architecture

Each element type receives comprehensive profiling across multiple dimensions:

#### Core Identity Components

- **Primary Function/Purpose:** What the element is designed or intended to do
- **Structural Characteristics:** Physical, organizational, or conceptual framework
- **Historical Development:** How the element evolved to its current state
- **Cultural Integration:** How the element fits within its broader context

#### Psychological Complexity Layers

- **Behavioral Patterns:** Predictable responses and interaction tendencies
- **Internal Tensions:** Contradictions and competing pressures within the element
- **Stress Responses:** How the element reacts under pressure or crisis conditions
- **Hidden Properties:** Non-obvious capabilities or characteristics that emerge under specific conditions

#### Dynamic Properties

- **Influence Patterns:** How the element affects other elements it interacts with
- **Evolution Potential:** Capacity for growth, change, or degradation over time
- **Breaking Points:** Conditions under which the element fails or transforms fundamentally
- **Interaction Vulnerabilities:** Specific other elements or conditions that create conflict or synergy

## Avatar Development System

### Psychological Architecture

#### Core Profile Components

**Identity Block:**

- Primary role/profession and experience level
- Relevant credentials, specializations, and current context
- Communication style and interaction preferences
- Professional biases, values, and typical concerns

**Expertise Framework:**

- Deep knowledge domains and adjacent competencies
- Known knowledge gaps and authentic limitations
- Preferred methodologies and analytical approaches
- Areas of uncertainty or evolving perspective

#### Character Depth Development

**Complexity Block:**

- Internal tensions between professional principles and personal ethics
- Intellectual uncertainties within their field of expertise
- Philosophical friction points where values clash with methods
- Experiential contradictions where theory and practice diverged

**Psychological Foundation:**

- Formative experiences shaping core assumptions about safety, authority, and trust
- Cultural imprints creating tension with professional environment
- Trauma-informed responses affecting risk assessment and collaboration patterns
- Unconscious bias patterns influencing attribution and decision-making

**Fundamental Orientation Spectrum:**

- **Constructive Extreme (2-5%):** Instinctive pattern recognition for building, healing, connecting
- **Destructive Extreme (2-5%):** Gravitates toward solutions involving elimination or dismantling  
- **Neutral Majority (90-95%):** Contextual responses varying by situation and incentives

#### TTRPG-Inspired Extensions

**Competency Mapping:** Raw cognitive capacity vs. trained expertise vs. social intelligence vs. intuitive pattern recognition

**Drives/Motivations:** Personal missions, fear-based vs. aspiration-based patterns, legacy concerns

**Relationship Templates:** Default interpersonal patterns, authority comfort levels, conflict resolution styles, trust dynamics

**Stress Responses:** Competence degradation under pressure, emotional override triggers, recovery patterns

**Hidden Assets/Limitations:** Undisclosed expertise, resource access, systematic blind spots, physical/cognitive constraints

**Growth Potential:** Areas for perspective evolution, worldview shift potential, skill development opportunities

### Avatar Types

**Human Avatars:** Traditional character development with full psychological complexity
**Synthetic Intelligence Avatars:** AI characters requiring different cognitive architectures but equal psychological depth

### Character Development Arcs

**Leveling System Concept:** Avatars progress through growth experiences that trigger formal profile updates

- Growth events and conflicts create development opportunities
- Character evolution tracked through systematic profile revisions
- Progression system shows authentic change rather than static archetype maintenance

**Evolutionary Development Framework:**

- **Level Triggers:** Specific story events that create character growth opportunities
- **Profile Updates:** Formal revisions to psychological architecture based on experiences
- **Consistency Tracking:** Maintaining core identity while allowing authentic change
- **Regression Potential:** Characters can also experience setbacks or trauma responses

### Avatar Development Initiation Prompt

```
You are developing an avatar profile for a [GENRE] narrative. This avatar will serve as a [ROLE/PROFESSION] with expertise in [DOMAIN].

Begin by exploring their professional identity and core competencies. What drew them to this field? What specific skills have they mastered, and where do they struggle?

Next, uncover their psychological foundation. What formative experiences shaped their worldview? What cultural background influences their perspective? Are there any trauma responses or unconscious biases that affect their decision-making?

Identify their fundamental orientation on the constructive-destructive spectrum. Do they instinctively build, heal, and connect? Do they gravitate toward solutions involving elimination or dismantling? Or do they fall in the contextual majority?

Finally, discover their internal contradictions. Where do their professional principles conflict with personal ethics? What intellectual uncertainties trouble them? What experiential contradictions have they encountered?

Create a complete avatar profile that feels like a real person with authentic complexity and growth potential.

#### Directory Structure Explanation

**`.memory/` - Core Development Artifacts**
This hidden directory contains all working development materials, keeping the project root clean while providing comprehensive context for AI tools.

- **`drafts/`**: Contains in-progress story content organized by version and title. These directories are removed once content is published to the main story directories. This separation allows for iterative development without cluttering the final story structure.

- **`elements/`**: Houses comprehensive narrative element profiles organized by type. Each subdirectory (`avatars/`, `organizations/`, etc.) contains individual element profiles with complete psychological and functional frameworks. These files serve as the foundation for all story development phases.

- **`sessions/`**: Stores outputs from the conversational development phases (Pre-Podcast Development, Exploratory Discussion, Content Curation). This preserves the creative discovery process and provides context for future sessions or revision needs.

- **`checkpoint.md`**: A dynamic context file generated at the end of each Collaborative Review phase. This single file optimizes context for the next development session, containing essential information for claude.ai while serving as a navigation starting point for web search discovery of deeper context.

**`.prompts/` - Template Management**
Contains standardized prompt templates organized by function, enabling consistent application of the workflow across different projects and development phases.

- **`elements/`**: Stores the narrative element development initiation prompts and specialized prompts for complex element types (synthetic intelligence avatars, evolutionary organizations, etc.).

- **`phases/`**: Contains the five core workflow phase prompts, customizable for different project types and development needs.

**`x.x-story-name/` - Published Content**
Published story chapters use semantic versioning (major.minor format) and descriptive names. This structure supports both standalone stories and series development while maintaining clear version progression.

**Configuration Files**

- **`claude.md`**: Claude Code configuration file optimizing the AI assistant for narrative development tasks and project-specific context
- **`readme.md`**: Project overview and setup instructions for collaborators

#### Context Management Strategy

The structure supports a hybrid context approach:

**Direct Upload Context (claude.ai)**: `checkpoint.md` provides optimized session context
**Discovery Context (Web Search)**: Full `.memory/` directory structure accessible through GitHub integration
**Implementation Context (Claude Code)**: Direct file access for all project materials during draft generation

This approach scales indefinitely while maintaining conversational efficiency in development phases.

### Front-Matter Standard for Markdown Documents

All markdown documents in the `.memory/` directory use standardized YAML front-matter to enable effective web search discovery, relationship tracking, and automated workflow management.

## Getting Started

### Minimum Viable Implementation

1. **Choose Primary Narrative Elements**: Select 2-3 element types most critical to your story (typically one avatar plus one supporting element)
2. **Use Development Initiation Prompts**: Create basic element profiles using the provided prompts for each selected type
3. **Run Simple Pre-Podcast Session**: Use the Pre-Podcast Development prompt to establish element profiles collaboratively
4. **Conduct Focused Exploratory Discussion**: Use the Exploratory Discussion prompt with your established elements
5. **Practice Curation Process**: Use the Content Curation prompt to extract and organize discussion results
6. **Test Output Format Implementation**: Verify that your curated content follows the standard output format

### Progressive Enhancement Path

1. **Expand Element Portfolio**: Add additional element types (scenes, organizations, technologies, philosophical frameworks) as confidence grows
2. **Implement Full Five-Phase Workflow**: Move from simplified testing to complete workflow execution using all provided prompts
3. **Develop Multi-Element Interactions**: Practice complex scenarios involving all five element types simultaneously
4. **Create Element Profile Libraries**: Build reusable collections of element profiles for different genres or recurring themes
5. **Experiment with Dynamic Evolution**: Test the evolutionary development systems for avatars, organizations, and technologies
6. **Scale to Full-Length Projects**: Apply the workflow to complete stories or extended narrative projects

### Success Metrics

- **Element Profile Quality**: Profiles feel psychologically authentic and complex rather than simplistic archetypes
- **Interaction Authenticity**: Different elements influence each other in realistic, meaningful ways
- **Conversation Flow**: Exploratory discussions generate compelling story development ideas naturally
- **Curation Effectiveness**: Essential content is preserved and organized clearly for implementation
- **Implementation Consistency**: Generated content maintains element authenticity while advancing narrative goals
- **Creative Enhancement**: The workflow enhances rather than constrains creative vision
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Each phase contributes meaningfully to overall story development without excessive overhead

### Common Implementation Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge**: Element profiles feel too complex or overwhelming
**Solution**: Start with simplified versions focusing on 2-3 key characteristics, then add complexity gradually

**Challenge**: Conversation management commands feel artificial or disruptive
**Solution**: Practice using commands sparingly and naturally; focus on `capture` for truly essential moments

**Challenge**: Multi-element interactions become confusing or contradictory
**Solution**: Begin with single-element focus, then add one additional element type at a time

**Challenge**: Curation process loses important discussion insights
**Solution**: Use conversation commands more frequently during discussion; review transcript multiple times with different focus areas

**Challenge**: Generated content doesn't capture the discussion's creative energy
**Solution**: Ensure curation output includes specific examples and emotional resonance notes, not just plot points
