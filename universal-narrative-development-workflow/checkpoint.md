## Current Framework Architecture

### Narrative Element System

**Five Element Types with Equal Psychological Complexity:**

- **Avatars**: Human/synthetic intelligence characters with complete psychological architectures
- **Scenes**: Environments with atmospheric personality and character-influencing properties  
- **Organizations**: Groups with collective psychology and cultural behavioral patterns
- **Technologies**: Tools with developmental arcs, philosophical implications, and adoption patterns
- **Philosophical Frameworks**: Living ideas that evolve through practical testing (static once established)

### Phased Workflow Process

1. **Pre-Podcast Development**: Comprehensive element profile creation
2. **Exploratory Discussion**: Podcast-style collaborative development using established elements
3. **Content Curation**: Extract and organize essential discoveries from exploratory sessions
4. **First Draft Generation**: AI writing using curated elements and dynamic perspective application
5. **Collaborative Review**: Joint revision maintaining creative vision and element authenticity
6. **Session Continuity Management**: Systematic checkpoint generation for optimized context handoff

### Dynamic Multi-Element Integration

- **Perspective Filtering**: Claude Code operates with a sophisticated dual-layer personality system during story generation. The AI maintains a passive baseline characteristic as a renowned creative writing author (providing technical competence and prose quality), while actively embodying the complete psychological framework of the assigned avatar profile. This means Claude Code literally becomes the character - adopting their cognitive patterns, emotional responses, decision-making processes, and worldview - rather than simply writing about them from an external perspective. The broader ecosystem of narrative elements (scene atmospheric influence, organizational cultural pressures, technology capabilities/limitations, philosophical framework guidance) then contextually influence how that embodied avatar personality responds and behaves within the story environment. This creates authentic character voice because the AI is actually thinking and reacting as the character would, while the environmental and systemic pressures shape those reactions realistically. The result is dynamic perspective application where not only can different avatars drive different story sections, but the fundamental personality conducting the writing shifts holistically to match each character's psychological architecture.

- **Element Evolution**: Avatars, organizations, and technologies develop through story events
- **Interaction Matrices**: Complex relationships between all element types
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic consistency checking across all elements

## Key Design Decisions Established

### Revolutionary Writing Approach

- **Psychological Embodiment System**: Avatar profiles serve dual purpose as both character representation and AI psychological transformation instructions
- **Dual-Layer AI Personality**: Claude Code maintains passive creative writing competence while actively embodying complete character psychological frameworks
- **Authentic Character Voice Through Cognitive Adoption**: AI becomes the character rather than writing about them, adopting their thought patterns, emotional responses, and decision-making processes

### Technology Architecture

- **File-Based Foundation**: Markdown files with YAML front-matter over MCP servers for core workflow
- **Hybrid Tool Approach**: claude.ai for conversational discovery + Claude Code for focused implementation with character embodiment
- **GitHub Integration**: Web search discovery for unlimited context scaling
- **Universal Accessibility**: No specialized dependencies beyond standard development tools

### Workflow Philosophy

- **Psychological Authenticity Over Simplicity**: All elements receive deep psychological development
- **Character Embodiment Over External Perspective**: AI psychological transformation rather than character description
- **Separation of Discovery and Execution**: Creative exploration separate from formal writing
- **Universal Scalability**: Same framework works across all narrative types
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Framework designed for continuous improvement and expansion

### Context Management Strategy

- **Checkpoint-Based Handoffs**: Single optimized context file for session continuity
- **Repository Discovery**: Unlimited historical context through web search
- **Active vs. Historical Context Split**: Immediate needs vs. discoverable depth

### Technical Decisions to Remember

- **Linux Compatibility Priority**: Framework must work without Claude Desktop dependency
- **Markdown File Preference**: Transparency and portability over abstraction and complexity
- **GitHub + VS Code Integration**: Leverages existing developer toolchain rather than requiring new tools
- **Conversation Management Commands**: Simple but powerful system for real-time curation during development

### Framework Philosophy Anchors

- **Psychological Authenticity**: All elements must feel like real entities with authentic complexity
- **Universal Scalability**: Framework adapts to any narrative type while maintaining core principles
- **Creative Enhancement**: Technology amplifies rather than constrains creative vision
- **Practical Utility**: Every component must contribute meaningfully to actual story development
