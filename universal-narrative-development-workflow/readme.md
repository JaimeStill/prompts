# Universal Narrative Development Workflow

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently in develompent and testing. Subject to change. See [Implementation Readiness Status](./implementation-guide.md#implementation-readiness-status).

A comprehensive AI-assisted framework for developing psychologically complex narratives that scale across any genre, time period, or story type.

## What This Is

This workflow transforms narrative development from simple character-driven plotting into a rich, multi-dimensional storytelling system where every story element—characters, environments, organizations, technologies, and philosophical frameworks—receives deep psychological development and authentic complexity.

## Core Approach

**Separation of Discovery and Execution**: Creative exploration happens through conversational sessions while formal writing uses AI tools optimized for implementation.

**Psychological Authenticity**: All narrative elements develop realistic behavioral patterns, internal contradictions, and growth potential rather than functioning as simple archetypes.

**Dynamic Element Interaction**: Story components influence each other in complex, meaningful ways that generate authentic narrative momentum.

**Universal Scalability**: The same framework adapts to medieval fantasy, contemporary drama, hard science fiction, or any other narrative type while maintaining psychological depth.

## Six-Phase Process

1. **Pre-Podcast Development** - Create comprehensive psychological profiles for all story elements
2. **Exploratory Discussion** - Podcast-style collaborative development using established element personalities
3. **Content Curation** - Extract and organize essential discoveries from exploratory sessions
4. **First Draft Generation** - AI writing using curated elements and dynamic perspective application
5. **Collaborative Review** - Joint revision maintaining creative vision and element authenticity
6. **Session Continuity Management** - Systematic context preparation for seamless workflow continuation

## Narrative Element System

### Five Element Types

- **Avatars**: Human or AI characters with complete psychological architectures
- **Scenes**: Environments with atmospheric personality and character-influencing properties
- **Organizations**: Groups with collective psychology and cultural behavioral patterns
- **Technologies**: Tools with developmental arcs, philosophical implications, and adoption patterns
- **Philosophical Frameworks**: Living ideas that evolve through practical testing and application

### Element Development

Each element receives comprehensive profiling including:

- Behavioral patterns and stress responses
- Internal contradictions and growth potential
- Interaction dynamics with other elements
- Evolution capabilities (for avatars, organizations, and technologies)

## Key Benefits

**Rich Narrative Density**: Multiple layers of authentic complexity in every scene through multi-element interaction

**Sustainable Development**: Context management system scales from short stories to full novel series

**Creative Enhancement**: Framework amplifies rather than constrains creative vision through systematic depth development

**Consistent Quality**: Psychological authenticity standards ensure character and world believability

**Flexible Implementation**: Works with claude.ai for conversational development and Claude Code for focused writing implementation

## Technology Integration

Designed for hybrid development using:

- **claude.ai**: Conversational phases for organic creative discovery
- **Claude Code + VS Code**: Focused implementation and project management
- **GitHub Integration**: Scalable context management and version control

## Getting Started

1. **Review Implementation Guide**: Read [`./implementation-guide.md`](./implementation-guide.md) for complete setup and usage instructions
2. **Choose Story Elements**: Select 2-3 primary narrative elements for your first project
3. **Set Up Project Structure**: Create the standardized directory organization
4. **Begin Development**: Start with Pre-Podcast Development to create your first element profiles

## Implementation Guide

For comprehensive setup instructions, detailed element development frameworks, specific prompt templates, and complete workflow procedures, see the **[Implementation Guide](./implementation-guide.md)**.

The implementation guide covers:

- Complete narrative element frameworks with psychological development systems
- Specific prompts for each workflow phase
- Project structure and context management protocols
- Quality assurance and consistency checking methods
- Advanced features including character evolution systems and long-form project management

## Workflow Status

This framework represents a production-ready system with comprehensive infrastructure for practical implementation. Current development focuses on advanced features including automated consistency validation, synthetic intelligence specifications, and enhanced project management capabilities.
